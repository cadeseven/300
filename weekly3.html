Poor images are a collection and a story. Each artifact of compression, every edit, crop, caption or remix is a mark from an owner that will get passed on down the line until that image no longer exists. Some of these marks are common and easy to spot: JPEG artifacts, generic Instagram filters, watermarks from image hosts; some, in fact, are so common that they're imitated on purpose, as a sort of satirical meta-joke that mirrors a long line of uploads, downloads, and reposts. For example, within meme culture there's a certain self awareness that everything is a copy of something else, taken from Facebook or Reddit or Imgur, and then posted onto another platform or sent in a message. Those privy to this take perfectly uncompressed images, edit them and recompress them to a laughable point, and repost them as a sort of commentary - a commentary about how in the past most internet users were incapable of reuploading uncompressed images, about how people tend to put unnecessary filters on non-photographs on facebook and instagram, about how people take photos and add captions and then call it their own. A prime example of this is this subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFriedMemes/</p>
<p>

People create poor images for the sake of creating poor images, even though most consumer-grade software and hardware is capable of outputting and ingesting HD content. At this point, most of the population that actively downloads and reuploads images and videos knows how to deal with compression so that images don't degrade to the point that they used to. Compression algorithms and widely available cloud storage allow for high res images all over the internet. However, as long as people continue to create, edit, remake and reupload, the poor image will continue to exist.
