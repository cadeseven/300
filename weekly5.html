The rise of cybernetics allowed researchers, the government, and the public in general understand human society as a machine or system; one that abides by a certain set of laws, propelled by human nature and the culture and society that we've built over centuries. Because human behavior is often fairly predictable on a large scale, cybernetics can be useful in understanding population dynamics, resource management, and other human behaviors that adhere to a pattern over time. The comparison of humans to computers is interesting as it essentially boils down the complexities of our nature, society and individual actions to a set of numbers and formulas; despite this, it's surprisingly accurate. Cybernetic models can predict other patterns, too, from the migration patterns of fish to the growth patterns of a forest. I found this interesting this semester because in my environmental science GE, we used simulation software every week to observe patterns of natural phenomena. Simulating weather patterns, animal behavior, population dynamics, and more was weird because the software was dated and clunky yet the results it output were so accurate at mirroring real life. It's incredible the extent to which computers can help us understand the incredibly complex patterns in nature.
