  Concept:
  <br>
  I already have a portfolio website, so for this one I want to work on something with a different concept. I want a body of my recent work to be displayed in a responsive grid layout: a mix of animation, video, photography, illustration and design. However I want this grid to change and rearrange itself every time the website is refreshed. I’m not sure if this is possible, but might as well try to do something cooler than what I have now. I want it to be simple and focused on the work.
  <br>
  Another concept I think would be cool is to create a website where everything is drawn and animated. Characters walk around the bottom of the screen and the links move around as well.

  Content:<br>
  Pretty much everything that’s on my current portfolio website: https://cademl.com
<br>
  The intended audience would be pretty much everyone that I send the URL to - possible employers, clients, friends. Further along I’d like to implement SEO so that people can find my work.
