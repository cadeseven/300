Dating back to the early days of the internet, Rand's philosophy held considerable influence with early Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. The idea of self-esteem as the epitome of moral values, as well as Rand's ideas of heroism and individualism inspired a generation of tech giants who shaped the developing landscape of the internet. Californian ideology took these ideas of individualism and freedom from government regulation and applied them to technology - many in Silicon Valley believed that the internet would empower people and create a system of individuals, all acting in their own self-interest, but ultimately working towards the good of all.

Ironically, the internet as it exists today is controlled in large part by major corporations. Amazon's hosting services, for example, account for up to 50% of all web traffic depending on your metric. Facebook and all of its platforms have nearly 2 billion monthly users, from whom they collect data on a large scale. Google, Microsoft, Apple, Oracle - the same Silicon Valley tech giants who pioneered the way for a free and open internet are now the ones who control a large majority of its content. However, it remains true that the internet itself (at least in the US) is still a largely unregulated, open platform available to all individuals - it's these very companies that fight for the people's right to an open internet. While many of these companies do regulate and control their own platforms, the internet itself remains free and open for everyone.
