Rauschenberg was a highly influential and innovative artist, questioning the role and purpose of art through a variety of mediums and techniques. Rauschenberg created unique, sometimes weird collages using found objects, trash, screen printing techniques, and 3D materials; he played on the line that divides art and life, using everyday objects to argue that the two are intimately intertwined. He incorporated newspaper clippings, clothing, image cutouts and more into very experimental pieces. Rauschenberg's work, using found items to create art, is even more interesting to look at through today's lens. It's reminiscent of internet art, using images and resources found online to create something completely new. Like Rauschenberg's use of trash in his collages, artists today often take seemingly worthless content from the internet and incorporate it into their art. Material was very important in Rauschenberg's collages, and the amount of material that artists have access to in the digital age is infinite; images, sound, video, metadata, and code are everywhere, available for anybody to take and turn into something new. <p>
