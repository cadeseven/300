Artificial intelligence and computational reasoning are by no means new or groundbreaking ideas, but in today's technological landscape they're more relevant than ever before. Lyotard, in his writings regarding the embodiment of thought, goes a step further than artificial intelligence (which can and does exist without a body) to distinguish the difference between computation and thought. He argues that computation is binary, and, therefore, all artificial intelligence is based at its core on binary "thinking". However, real human thought is not binary - it's informed by past experiences, influenced by emotion, shaped through language and context. Therefore, human thought is unique and dependent on all aspects of being a human, including body. Interestingly he also links this to gender, and the presence (or absence) of masculinity and femininity within all individuals. According to Lyotard, thought is ingrained not only in experience and body but also in gender, not as a construct but as an inherent property.
